      <p class="i">Brainstorming Idea!</p>
      <p class="m" >Everything came into being with an fantastic idea! Just like mine...This journey begins with the obstacles that i surrender while purchasing things mostly mobile phones.I have to visit different marketplace frequently in order to fulfill my needs. By doing so, i realize that the difficulty i face, Many facing it daily or let's say it's a boredom routine now!</p>
      <p class="m" >So, i decided to overcome this awkwardness by giving a comfortable
      platform to ease humanity and i make it possible by giving them a site
      on which they are free to survey and find their needs just by doing some clicks</p>
      <p class="m" >By doing this we are promoting our markets & shops also by enhancing the visibility of products
      they own. We publicly branding their products and showing them on the main page of our site</p>

      </div>
      <p class="m" style="    margin: 0 0 26px;">
        I gather my teammate and discuss this idea, he liked alot. Then we both work on it and resolve
        each and every drawbacks in it. We collect all the reviews, say that from a businessman to a common person.</p>
      <p class="o">
        And then we realize that we are incomplete without a technical guy and this need is fulfilled by
        our beloved friend who understands us & we three became partners till this day...
        And we achive it in some 180 days with lots of coffee :)</p>
